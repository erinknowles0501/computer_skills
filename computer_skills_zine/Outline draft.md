### Introduction
What this is for, how it works, expectations, who I am
This guide assumes you know a computer is a machine that you interact with using a mouse and keyboard, and no more. That said, there's probably useful stuff in this guide even for young people who are pretty savvy - and if you're really savvy, you can contribute by making a pull request on github.

### Quick basics to get you started
 - How to connect to the internet (troubleshooting?)
 - What is a computer program, what is a browser, how to open it, how to use it (where url bar is and how it works, bookmarks, history)
 - (Mention that your internet provider probably isn't looking, but it's technically possible for them to see what pages you look at - which means if you search for "pictures of cute puppies" they'll see that you searched for that. Also, the browser's history will contain that you searched for that, unless you delete it, and might also show up in "recently searched")
 - Briefly what a search engine is and basics of how to use it (link to search engines section)
 - Basically impossible to "break" your computer or phone by interacting with it
 - If you don't understand something I've mentioned, or want more information, you can google it to find out
 - How signing up for something works (email, password) and what to look out for
 - How to email and use social media (and what to look out for)

### Social media
 - "Don't compare your life to someone else's highlight reel"
 - People misrepresent information all the time, on purpose or by accident. Be careful of what you believe, and why. And remember - when finding out whether something is true, be careful of whether you believe what you find about whether it's true!
 - Consider the difference between what you've experienced and what you've heard
 - "Credulity is the eighth deadly sin"
 - Consider why something was posted - are they trying to sell a narrative? Are they trying to generate attention? Are they making themselves look/feel good? 
 - Briefly mention filters, what they do, and that they can be applied even to live video, and that they can be spotted.
 - See: privacy and the internet - most social media sites and apps have settings you can change about who can see what you post, like, comment on.
 - See: the right to be forgotten
 - Scams and 'hacking' and impersonation

### Artificial Intelligence
 - mention deepfakes
 - mention how quickly this is changing and being developed - give Midjourney example of "obviously generated" to "indistinguishable" in one year
 - mention chatgpt

### Programming
- Computers and cell phones and apps and websites (and, these days, probably your fridge, your tv, and your car) have been programmed using code, which is like a language that humans use to tell computers how to work. It might look a little like this:
- if (userInput) {
    doAction()
- }
Which could read in English as "if user input of a certain kind exists, do a certain action". Now the computer knows to do that action when the user interacts with it in a certain way - for example, to put the letter "h" into the document the user is writing when they press the H key.
Anyone can learn computer programming, including you!! There are dozens of really great free online resources. 
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" - unless you know how it works! This is the reason I'm writing this guide, really - we have a responsibility to understand the technology we use, so that WE can decide how we want to use and benefit from it - not someone else.


### Websites of note
- Youtube - watch and upload videos.
- Reddit - read and talk about specific topics - there are subreddits for knitting, fishing,
