### Introduction
What this is for, how it works, expectations, who I am
This guide assumes you know a computer is a machine that you interact with using a mouse and keyboard, that a smart phone is a small computer, and that the internet connects computers so that computers and their users can talk to each other. That said, there's useful stuff in this guide even for teens+adults who are pretty savvy - and if you're really savvy, you can contribute by making a pull request on github: 


### Social media
 - "Don't compare your life to someone else's highlight reel"
 - People misrepresent information all the time, on purpose or by accident. Be careful of what you believe, and why. And remember - when finding out whether something is true, be careful of whether you believe what you find about whether it's true!
 - Consider the difference between what you've experienced and what you've heard
 - "Credulity is the eighth deadly sin"
 - Consider why something was posted - are they trying to sell a narrative? Are they trying to generate attention? Are they making themselves look/feel good? 
 - Briefly mention filters, what they do, and that they can be applied even to live video, and that they can be spotted.
 - See: privacy and the internet - most social media sites and apps have settings you can change about who can see what you post, like, comment on.
 - See: the right to be forgotten
 - Scams and 'hacking' and impersonation

### Artificial Intelligence
 - mention deepfakes
 - mention how quickly this is changing and being developed - give Midjourney example of "obviously generated" to "indistinguishable" in one year
 - mention chatgpt
 - explain basics of language models - it's just saying the most likely string of words, it doesn't "know" anything and can therefore be wrong (lie/hallucinate)

### Programming
- Computers and cell phones and apps and websites (and, these days, probably your fridge, your tv, and your car) have been programmed using code, which is like a language that humans use to tell computers how to work. It might look a little like this:
- if (userInput) {
    doAction()
- }
Which could read in English as "if user input of a certain kind exists, do a certain action". Now the computer knows to do that action when the user interacts with it in a certain way - for example, to put the letter "h" into the document the user is writing when they press the H key.
Anyone can learn computer programming, including you!! There are dozens of really great free online resources. 
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" - unless you know how it works! This is the reason I'm writing this guide, really - we have a responsibility to understand the technology we use, so that WE can decide how we want to use and benefit from it - not someone else.


### Websites of note
- **Youtube** - upload videos, watch videos on basically any topic. Especially useful for:
	- learning small specific things, like for example "how to change the drum belt on my 2013 LG clothes dryer".
	- Finding and playing music - has music videos for basically everything
- Reddit - read and talk about specific topics - there are forums for knitting, fishing, gardening, music, basically anything
- **Libgen** and **Anna's Archive** - huge libraries of free digital books. Semi-legal.
- Kijiji
- KhanAcademy
