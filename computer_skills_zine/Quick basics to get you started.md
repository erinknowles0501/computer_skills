**It is basically impossible to break your computer or phone by interacting with it, and exploring is a great way to learn.**

I also strongly recommend learning how to google things (see below), because then you can teach yourself anything I might have missed, including specific instructions for your particular computer, cell phone, internet browser, email provider, etc, and more information on topics I bring up.
### What is 'googling'?
"Google" (noun) is a popular search engine (a website that shows you other websites based on what you're looking for).
To "google" (verb) is to use a search engine (any search engine, not necessarily Google) to find information. 
Example: "I didn't understand this acronym I read, so I googled it". 
### How to google something
1. On your smart phone or computer, open the internet browser (an app or program that lets you interact with the internet by looking at websites) by clicking/tapping it. You may have to double-click if you're on a computer. The app icon will probably look like one of these: 
2. If the app displays a notice about "no internet", check out the "Connecting to the internet" section, and then come back when you've connected to the internet.
3. Look for a bar at the top of the screen which you can enter text in. It might look like one of these:
   This is the URL and search bar, where you can type in a website's address to visit it ("google.ca" is Google's URL/address) or a search term, like "what does URL stand for". Type Enter or click/tap the arrow to finish typing and go to the website/search results.
#### Tips:
- Search engine results often include a 'summary' at the top. This summary is computer-generated and is not always accurate.
- Google is a very popular search engine, but it's not necessarily the best, and there are alternatives that offer more privacy and transparency (I talk more about this later)
- Google or Bing will probably be the default search engine for your browser. You can change the default to a different search engine via a setting.
- Anything you type into the search/URL bar will probably be recorded by default, and will then be visible to your internet provider, to the search engine you use, and to anyone else who uses your computer/phone. There are things you can do about this too (see the privacy section)

### Some terminology

### Computer terminology vs smartphone terminology
A user navigates their computer by clicking on things with their mouse, and they navigate their smartphone by tapping on things on the screen with their finger. These are the primary methods of interacting with these devices, and are basically interchangeable, so I

 - (Mention that your internet provider probably isn't looking, but it's technically possible for them to see what pages you look at - which means if you search for "pictures of cute puppies" they'll see that you searched for that. Also, the browser's history will contain that you searched for that, unless you delete it, and might also show up in "recently searched")
